			<h1>Writer. Engineer. Analyst.</h1>
			<p>Hi! I am Courtney and I am here to help make the web be a better place. Starting with content; Content I find on web pages are often long-winded and don't get the point across. Instead they are commands, not experiences. Ideally it should be: Anything worth reading is worth saying; But the web is littered with bad grammar, run-on sentences, biases, poor design, that cause the web to become a place difficult to discern information. Together, let's make a difference in fighting against all these follies, and value it more as a prized memoir, of us.</p>
		<h2>A little about me</h2>
			<p>I could make this website like other portfolios, and shift the tone to, "Why you should hire me", but I am not all about that life. I am here to prove a point. I am here to write, to document, and to display my expertise. Many things we may not agree with, but we're both human. We can be wrong, we can have a point, and we can have the capacity to understand each other.</p>
